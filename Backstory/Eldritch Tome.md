I opened a fucked up book, allowing something trapped within to escape through my eyes, my mind, and away into the night. And I am certain it took something of me with it.

I fear losing more of myself to it, but it cannot take what I bind instead to a tome of my own. My journal is my protection, kept every night, kept close, kept safe â€” a part of me apart from me, a reliquary of memory to preserve a self that may be stolen.

I do not know what I have freed, but I know the answer lies somewhere in the night sky; I feel my mind tethered still, pulled by distant stars.
